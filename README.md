# Idea
* Back-end: Meteor and its DDP + Optimistic UI is wonderful for a rapid deployment and server-side js programming.
* Front-end: Vuejs and Vuetify are great for full-stack developers that want to learn and deliver software fast and continuosly. Even more, vuetify components give the ui an amazing look.
* User Authentication: Auth0 is a reliable authorization platform that allows several types of authentication, including social media, without having to write a line of code, and with instant results. Auth0 interacts in this boilerplate with meteor-accounts so you might want to use Meteor.user() and Meteor.userId() in both, client and server side.
* Vuex for state management.
* VueRouter for route management.
* EventBus for event listening.
